                There's a quote from Richard Feynman that inspired me to pursue the path of AI as a means to understand natural intelligence: <i>"What I cannot create, I do not understand."</i> Although it's debatable whether we can fully understand intelligence by building an artificial brain that functions in the same way, at the very least, we gain insight into one possible set of ingredients that can give rise to intelligence. Upon reflection, I realized that, rather than understand the biological brain itself, I'm more fascinated by creating intelligence, even if it differs from its biological counterpart. That said, I still believe it must share certain abstract similarities with how our brains work in order to be "truly intelligent." Ultimately, I want to ask: what are the minimal requirements for the emergence of intelligence, and do those requirements exist within our own brains?
